# Swift-Particles

Browsing the net today I came accross [Sketch.js](http://soulwire.github.io/sketch.js/) and a [Particle demo](http://soulwire.github.io/sketch.js/examples/particles.html). I quite liked it so spent an hour or so to implement (port js really..) something similar in Swift.

It brought back memories of writing games in action script, which was great.
